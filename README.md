this is a test how to put files on github

- 1st login:
browse to: github.com
click: Sign up
 choose username, email and password
 open email and click Verify email address

- next logins:
 browse to: github.com
 click: Sign in 
 enter login data

- create a new repository:
 on the left side click on: New repository
 give it a name
 click on: Create repository

- add files to repository:
 on the top there are 3 buttons:
+ Create new file (to create files with the github editor)
+ Upload files (a page opens where you can upload files and folders from your local pc)
+ Find files

 if you change a local file, then you have to re-upload it
(uploading files or directories might take some time - depending on the size of the files,
so i propose to avoid uploading unnecessary files.)


there is no additional tool needed to upload files.
you might need to use additional tools (like git bash) if you want to make automatic updates
or work with many persons on one project.
